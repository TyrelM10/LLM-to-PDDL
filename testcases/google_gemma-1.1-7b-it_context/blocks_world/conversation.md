**google_gemma-1.1-7b-it -Managing Context - BLOCKS WORLD**
_**System Prompt**: Generate PDDL domain code for natural language text descriptions. Do not add comments to the code._ [Conversation Link](https://hf.co/chat/r/cL4rFS3)
**STEP 1:**
**USER:**
The blocks world is one of the most famous planning domains in artificial intelligence. Imagine a set of cubes (blocks) sitting on a table. The goal is to build one or more vertical stacks of blocks. The catch is that only one block may be moved at a time: it may either be placed on the table or placed atop another block. Because of this, any blocks that are, at a given time, under another block cannot be moved.

Requirement: Generate PDDL domain code for the above text description in code blocks delimited only between ```pddl <CODE></CODE> ```. Do not give any explanations.

**LLM MODEL (google_gemma-1.1-7b-it):**
```
(:domain blocks)

(:objects
    (block A)
    (block B)
    (block C)
    table)

(:predicates
    (:on ?block1 ?block2) ; Block ?block1 is on top of block ?block2 or on the table.
    (:free ?block) ; Block ?block is not under another block.

(:actions
    (:move ?block ?location) {
        (assert (on ?block ?location))
        (assert (not (free ?block)))
    }
)

(:goals
    (:stack ?block1 ?block2 ...)) ; Build a stack of blocks, starting with ?block1 and ending with ?block2.
