**USER** :
Imagine you want to walk with your partner a long clockwise circular route over several days (e.g. in the "Lake District" in NW England), and you do one "leg" each day. You want to start at a certain point and do the walk in one direction, without ever walking backwards. You have two cars which you must use to carry your tent/luggage and to carry you and your partner to the start/end of a leg, if necessary. Driving a car between any two points is allowed, but walking must be done with your partner and must start from the place where you left off. As you will be tired when you have walked to the end of a leg, you must have your tent up ready there so you can sleep the night before you set off to do the next leg the morning.

 The above code produces the following error: There is a semantic error where unknown predicate 'not' used in precondition of action. Remove 'not' from the precondition of all actions having it.

 Requirement 1: Correct the error and give the entire PDDL code. 
 Requirement 2: Do not create a problem file. Do not use conditional expressions. 
 Requirement 3: Generate PDDL domain code in code blocks delimited only between ```pddl <CODE></CODE> ```. Do not give any explanations.
