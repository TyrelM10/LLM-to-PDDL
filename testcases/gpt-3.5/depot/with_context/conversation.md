**GPT-3.5 - Managing Context - DEPOT** [Conversation Link](https://chat.openai.com/share/daf76ab3-c7a0-4e64-8bf1-071ba47caf1b)

**STEP 1:**
**USER:**
This domain was devised in order to see what would happen if two previously well-researched domains were joined together. These were the logistics and blocks domains. They are combined to form a domain in which trucks can transport crates around and then the crates must be stacked onto pallets at their destinations. The stacking is achieved using hoists, so the stacking problem is like a blocks-world problem with hands. Trucks can behave like "tables", since the pallets on which crates are stacked are limited.

Requirement: Generate PDDL domain code for the above text description in code blocks delimited only between ```pddl <CODE></CODE> ```. Do not give any explanations.

**LLM MODEL (GPT-3.5-Turbo):**
```
(define (domain logistics-blocks)
  (:requirements :strips :typing)
  (:types truck crate pallet - object)
  (:predicates 
    (at ?obj - object ?loc - object)
    (on ?c - crate ?p - pallet)
    (empty ?t - truck)
    (loaded ?t - truck ?c - crate)
    (clear ?p - pallet)
    (hoist-empty)
    (holding ?c - crate)
  )

  (:action load
    :parameters (?t - truck ?c - crate)
    :precondition (and (at ?t - truck ?loc - object) (at ?c - crate ?loc))
    :effect (and (not (at ?c ?loc)) (loaded ?t ?c))
  )

  (:action unload
    :parameters (?t - truck ?c - crate)
    :precondition (and (at ?t - truck ?loc - object) (loaded ?t ?c))
    :effect (and (at ?c ?loc) (not (loaded ?t ?c)))

    :precondition (and (holding ?c) (clear ?p))
    :effect (and (on ?c ?p) (clear ?c) (not (holding ?c)))
  )

**BELOW IS THE PART TO GET THE PROBLEM FROM THE LLM FOR THIS DOMAIN TO SOLVE**

**USER:**
For the above the PDDL domain code, create a problem file in PDDL that when put into a planner to solve will give valid actions and an action path to reach a goal.

**LLM MODEL (GPT-3.5-Turbo):**
```
(define (problem logistics-blocks-problem)
  (:domain logistics-blocks)
  (:objects 
    truck1 truck2 - truck
    crate1 crate2 - crate
    pallet1 pallet2 - pallet
    location1 location2 - object
  )
  (:init
    (at truck1 location1)
    (at truck2 location2)
    (at crate1 location1)
    (at crate2 location2)
    (at pallet1 location1)
    (at pallet2 location2)
    (empty truck1)
    (empty truck2)
    (hoist-empty)
    (clear pallet1)
    (clear pallet2)
  )
  (:goal
    (and 
      (on crate1 pallet1)
      (on crate2 pallet2)
    )
  )
)
```

**NOTE:** The problem was parsed and solved without any action path found. Hence further giving a prompt below to the LLM to solve this.
**<span style="color:red">{'success': True, 'action_path': None, 'message': 'Action Path Sucessfully Found.'}</span>**

**USER:**
The above problem solved but did not produce an action path. Please create a new problem such that it outputs a action path when solved by a planner.

**LLM MODEL (GPT-3.5-Turbo):**
```
(define (problem logistics-blocks-problem)
  (:domain logistics-blocks)
  (:objects 
    truck1 truck2 - truck
    crate1 crate2 - crate
    pallet1 pallet2 - pallet
    location1 location2 - object
  )
  (:init
    (at truck1 location1)
    (at truck2 location2)
    (at crate1 location1)
    (at crate2 location2)
    (empty truck1)
    (empty truck2)
    (hoist-empty)
    (clear pallet1)
    (clear pallet2)
  )
  (:goal
    (and 
      (on crate1 pallet1)
      (on crate2 pallet2)
    )
  )
  (:metric minimize (total-cost))
)
```

**USER:**
On trying to solve the above the following error was received --> There was an error in parsing the code for expected to be at end.

Requirement: Correct the error and give a new problem file only.

**LLM MODEL (GPT-3.5-Turbo):**
```
(define (problem logistics-blocks-problem)
  (:domain logistics-blocks)
  (:objects 
    truck1 truck2 - truck
    crate1 crate2 - crate
    pallet1 pallet2 - pallet
    location1 location2 - object
  )
  (:init
    (at truck1 location1)
    (at truck2 location2)
    (at crate1 location1)
    (at crate2 location2)
    (empty truck1)
    (empty truck2)
    (hoist-empty)
    (clear pallet1)
    (clear pallet2)
  )
  (:goal
    (and 
      (on crate1 pallet1)
      (on crate2 pallet2)
    )
  )
)
```

**NOTE:** Same error as before and leaving to that.
**<span style="color:red">{'success': True, 'action_path': None, 'message': 'Action Path Sucessfully Found.'}</span>**

**USER:**
For the above domain file please rewrite the domain without using ':typing' and give a new PDDL domain code.

**USER:**
The above code produces the following error -> There is a semantic error where unknown type 'crate' is used in predicate definition.

Requirement 1: Correct the error and give the entire pddl domain code. 
Requirement 2: Do not create a problem file. Do not use conditional expressions.
