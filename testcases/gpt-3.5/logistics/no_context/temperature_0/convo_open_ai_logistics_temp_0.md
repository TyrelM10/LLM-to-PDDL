**USER** :
There are several cities, each containing several locations, some of which are airports. There are also trucks, which can drive within a single city, and airplanes, which can fly between airports. The goal is to get some packages from various locations to various new locations. This domain was created by Bart Selman and Henry Kautz, based on an earlier domain by Manuela Veloso.
 
 Requirement: Generate PDDL domain code for the above text description in code blocks delimited only between ```pddl <CODE></CODE> ```. Do not give any explanations.

 The above code produces the following error: There is a semantic error of unknown parent type: vehicle

 Requirement 1: Correct the error and give the entire PDDL code. 
 Requirement 2: Do not create a problem file. Do not use conditional expressions. 
 Requirement 3: Generate PDDL domain code in code blocks delimited only between ```pddl <CODE></CODE> ```. Do not give any explanations.
