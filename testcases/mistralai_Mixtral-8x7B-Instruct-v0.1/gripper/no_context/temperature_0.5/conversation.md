**USER** :
There is a robot with two grippers. It can carry a ball in each. The goal is to take N balls from one room to another; N rises with problem number. Some planners treat the two grippers asymmetrically, giving rise to an unnecessary combinatorial explosion. This domain was created by Jana Koehler.
 
 Instruction: Generate PDDL domain code for the above text description in code blocks delimited only between ```pddl <CODE></CODE> ```. This code should be solved in a STRIPS Planner. Do not give any explanations in the output.

The above code produces the following error -> There is a value error where keywords have to start with a colon ":". For example, ":requirements", ":predicates", ":action", ":parameters", ":precondition" and ":effect" are valid keywords.

Instruction 1: Correct the error and give the entire PDDL code in code blocks and please do not give any explanations in the output.
Instruction 2: Do not create a problem file and do not use conditional expressions.

The above code produces the following error -> There is a value error on finding unknown keyword in domain definition: 'predicate'.

The above code produces the following error -> There is a semantic error where unknown predicate 'not' used in precondition of action name 'pickup'. Remove negative literals from the precondition of the action having it and rewrite that action only.

Instruction 1: Correct the error and give the entire PDDL code in code blocks and please do not give any explanations in the output.
Instruction 2: Do not create a problem file and do not use conditional expressions.
