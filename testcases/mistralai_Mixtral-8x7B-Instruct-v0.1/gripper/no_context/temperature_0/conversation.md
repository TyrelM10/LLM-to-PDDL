**USER** :
There is a robot with two grippers. It can carry a ball in each. The goal is to take N balls from one room to another; N rises with problem number. Some planners treat the two grippers asymmetrically, giving rise to an unnecessary combinatorial explosion. This domain was created by Jana Koehler.
 
 Requirement: Generate PDDL domain code for the above text description in code blocks delimited only between ```pddl <CODE></CODE> ```. This code should be solved in a STRIPS Planner. Do not give any explanations.

 The above code produces the following error: There is a semantic error where unknown predicate 'not' used in precondition of action. Remove 'not' from the precondition of all actions having it.

 Requirement 1: Correct the error and give the entire PDDL code for a STRIPS Planner. 
 Requirement 2: Do not create a problem file. Do not use conditional expressions. 
 Requirement 3: Generate PDDL domain code in code blocks for a STRIPS Planner. Do not give any explanations.
