**USER** :
There is a robot with two grippers. It can carry a ball in each. The goal is to take N balls from one room to another; N rises with problem number. Some planners treat the two grippers asymmetrically, giving rise to an unnecessary combinatorial explosion. This domain was created by Jana Koehler.
 
 Requirement: Generate PDDL domain code for the above text description in code blocks delimited only between ```pddl <CODE></CODE> ```. This code should be solved in a STRIPS Planner. Do not give any explanations.
**LLM MODEL** (HUGGING_FACE):
```pddl
(define (domain robotic-ball-transport)
  (:requirements :strips :typing)
  
  (:types room object - thing)
  (:constants n - integer)
  
  (:predicates
    (carrying ?r - robot ?b - ball)
    (inroom ?x - object ?r - room)
    (at ?r1 - robot ?r2 - room)
  )
  
  (:action pickup
    :parameters (?r - robot ?b - ball ?fromRoom - room)
    :precondition (and (at ?r ?fromRoom) (inroom ?b ?fromRoom))
    :effect (and (not (inroom ?b ?fromRoom)) (carrying ?r ?b)))
  
  (:action putdown
    :parameters (?r - robot ?b - ball ?toRoom - room)
    :precondition (and (carrying ?r ?b) (at ?r ?toRoom))
    :effect (and (not (carrying ?r ?b)) (inroom ?b ?toRoom)))
  
  (:action move
    :parameters (?r1 - robot ?r2 - room)
    :precondition (at ?r1 ?r1)
    :effect (and (not (at ?r1 ?r1)) (at ?r1 ?r2))))

 The above code produces the following error: There is a semantic error of unknown parent type: thing

 Requirement 1: Correct the error and give the entire PDDL code for a STRIPS Planner. 
 Requirement 2: Do not create a problem file. Do not use conditional expressions. 
 Requirement 3: Generate PDDL domain code in code blocks for a STRIPS Planner. Do not give any explanations.
