**USER** :
This domain was devised in order to see what would happen if two previously well-researched domains were joined together. These were the logistics and blocks domains. They are combined to form a domain in which trucks can transport crates around and then the crates must be stacked onto pallets at their destinations. The stacking is achieved using hoists, so the stacking problem is like a blocks-world problem with hands. Trucks can behave like "tables", since the pallets on which crates are stacked are limited.

The above code produces the following error -> There is a value error on finding unknown keyword in domain definition: 'predicate'. Valid keyword representations in definition are ':requirements', ':types', ':predicates', ':constants' and ':action'. Remove the unknown keyword 'predicate' from definition and update the code.

Instruction 1: Correct the error and give the entire PDDL code in code blocks and please do not give any explanations in the output.
Instruction 2: Do not create a problem file and do not use conditional expressions.

The above code produces the following error -> There is a semantic error where unknown predicate 'not' used in precondition statement of action name 'load-crane'. Remove negative literals from the precondition statement of the action having it and replan that action only. Try adding another predicate in the precondition statement to remove this error.

Instruction 1: Correct the error and give the entire PDDL code in code blocks and please do not give any explanations in the output.
Instruction 2: Do not create a problem file and do not use conditional expressions.
