**mistralai_Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1 -Managing Context - BLOCKS WORLD**
_**System Prompt**: Generate PDDL domain code for natural language text descriptions. Do not add comments to the code._ [Conversation Link](https://hf.co/chat/r/QmCBNAt)
**STEP 1:**
**USER:**
The blocks world is one of the most famous planning domains in artificial intelligence. Imagine a set of cubes (blocks) sitting on a table. The goal is to build one or more vertical stacks of blocks. The catch is that only one block may be moved at a time: it may either be placed on the table or placed atop another block. Because of this, any blocks that are, at a given time, under another block cannot be moved.

Requirement: Generate PDDL domain code for the above text description in code blocks delimited only between ```pddl <CODE></CODE> ```. Do not give any explanations.

**LLM MODEL (Mistral-8X_7B):**
```pddl
(define (domain blocks)
    (:requirements :strips :typing)

    (:types
        block
    )
    (:predicates
        (on ?x - block ?y - block)
        (ontable ?x - block)
        (clear ?x - block)
        (handempty)
        (holding ?x - block)
    )

    (:action pick-up
        :parameters (?x - block)
        :precondition (and (clear ?x) (ontable ?x) (handempty))
        :effect (and (not (ontable ?x)) (not (clear ?x)) (not (handempty)) (holding ?x))
    )

    (:action put-down
        :parameters (?x - block)
        :precondition (holding ?x)
        :effect (and (ontable ?x) (clear ?x) (handempty) (not (holding ?x)))
    )

    (:action stack
        :parameters (?x - block ?y - block)
        :precondition (and (holding ?x) (clear ?y))
        :effect (and (on ?x ?y) (clear ?x) (handempty) (not (holding ?x)) (not (clear ?y)))
    )
)
```

**BELOW IS THE PART TO GET THE PROBLEM FROM THE LLM FOR THIS DOMAIN TO SOLVE**

**USER:**
For the above the PDDL domain code, create a problem file in PDDL that when put into a planner to solve will give valid actions and an action path to reach a goal.

**LLM MODEL (Mistral-8X_7B):**
```pddl
(define (problem blocks-1)
  (:domain blocks)
  (:objects A B C - block)
  (:init
    (clear A) (ontable A)
    (clear B) (ontable B)
    (clear C) (ontable C)
    (handempty))
  (:goal (and (on A B) (on B C))))
```
This problem describes a scenario with three blocks A, B, and C initially placed on the table. The goal state requires block A to be stacked over block B, which should further have block C underneath both. This setup violates the stability requirement from the initial state but serves as an example to demonstrate possible actions towards achieving the desired configuration. Note that a correct plan would involve picking up each block individually while respecting their weights and sizes if present; however, since those factors aren't included in the provided domain model, we can simply list them in alphabetical order instead. Additionally, you might need multiple trials before finding a successful sequence due to non-determinism inherent in the problem definition.

**On Putting the two codes in Pyperplan validator we get the following result:**

**<span style="color:green">{'success': True, 'action_path': [<Op (pick-up b)>, <Op (stack b c)>, <Op (pick-up a)>, <Op (stack a b)>], 'message': 'Action Path Sucessfully Found.'}</span>**
