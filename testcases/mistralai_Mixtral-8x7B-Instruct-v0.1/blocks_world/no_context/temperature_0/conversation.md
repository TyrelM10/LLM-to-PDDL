**USER** :
The blocks world is one of the most famous planning domains in artificial intelligence. Imagine a set of cubes (blocks) sitting on a table. The goal is to build one or more vertical stacks of blocks. The catch is that only one block may be moved at a time: it may either be placed on the table or placed atop another block. Because of this, any blocks that are, at a given time, under another block cannot be moved.
 
 Instruction: Generate PDDL domain code for the above text description in code blocks delimited only between ```pddl <CODE></CODE> ```. This code should be solved in a STRIPS Planner. Do not give any explanations in the output.

The above code produces the following error -> There is a semantic error where unknown predicate 'not' used in precondition of action name 'pick-up'. Remove negative literals from the precondition of the action having it and rewrite that action only.

Instruction 1: Correct the error and give the entire PDDL code in code blocks and please do not give any explanations in the output.
Instruction 2: Do not create a problem file and do not use conditional expressions.

The above code produces the following error -> There is a value error on finding unknown keyword in domain definition: ':types'. Valid keywords in definition are 'requirements', 'types', 'predicates', 'constants' and 'action'. Remove the keyword ':types' from definition, keep the rest of code the same.
