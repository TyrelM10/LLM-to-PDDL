**USER** :
The blocks world is one of the most famous planning domains in artificial intelligence. Imagine a set of cubes (blocks) sitting on a table. The goal is to build one or more vertical stacks of blocks. The catch is that only one block may be moved at a time: it may either be placed on the table or placed atop another block. Because of this, any blocks that are, at a given time, under another block cannot be moved.
 
 Requirement: Generate PDDL domain code for the above text description in code blocks delimited only between ```pddl <CODE></CODE> ```. This code should be solved in a STRIPS Planner. Do not give any explanations.
**LLM MODEL** (HUGGING_FACE):
```pddl domain code for the Blocks World problem as described in your question:
