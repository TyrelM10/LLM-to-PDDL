**USER** :
The blocks world is one of the most famous planning domains in artificial intelligence. Imagine a set of cubes (blocks) sitting on a table. The goal is to build one or more vertical stacks of blocks. The catch is that only one block may be moved at a time: it may either be placed on the table or placed atop another block. Because of this, any blocks that are, at a given time, under another block cannot be moved.
 
 Instruction: Generate PDDL domain code for the above text description in code blocks delimited only between ```pddl <CODE></CODE> ```. This code should be solved in a STRIPS Planner. Do not give any explanations in the output.

The above code produces the following error -> There is a value error on finding unknown keyword in domain definition: 'predicate'. Valid keywords in definition are 'requirements', 'types', 'predicates', 'constants' and 'action'. Remove the keyword 'predicate' from definition, keep the rest of code the same.

Instruction 1: Correct the error and give the entire PDDL code in code blocks and please do not give any explanations in the output.
Instruction 2: Do not create a problem file and do not use conditional expressions.

The above code produces the following error -> There is a semantic error where unknown predicate 'on' used in effect of action stack. Please do not use 'on' and use existing predicates from the above code only. Please do not use any conditional expression in the code to remove this error.

Instruction 1: Correct the error and give the entire PDDL code in code blocks and please do not give any explanations in the output.
Instruction 2: Do not create a problem file and do not use conditional expressions.
