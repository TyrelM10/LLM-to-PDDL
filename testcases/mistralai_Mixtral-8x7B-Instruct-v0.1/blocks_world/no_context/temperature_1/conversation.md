**USER** :
The blocks world is one of the most famous planning domains in artificial intelligence. Imagine a set of cubes (blocks) sitting on a table. The goal is to build one or more vertical stacks of blocks. The catch is that only one block may be moved at a time: it may either be placed on the table or placed atop another block. Because of this, any blocks that are, at a given time, under another block cannot be moved.
 
 Requirement: Generate PDDL domain code for the above text description in code blocks delimited only between ```pddl <CODE></CODE> ```. This code should be solved in a STRIPS Planner. Do not give any explanations.

 The above code produces the following error: There is a value error where keywords have to start with a colon ":"

 Requirement 1: Correct the error and give the entire PDDL code for a STRIPS Planner. 
 Requirement 2: Do not create a problem file. Do not use conditional expressions. 
 Requirement 3: Generate PDDL domain code in code blocks delimited only between ```pddl <CODE></CODE> ```for a STRIPS Planner. Do not give any explanations.
