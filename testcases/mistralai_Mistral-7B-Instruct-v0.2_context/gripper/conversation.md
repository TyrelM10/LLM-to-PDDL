**mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 -Managing Context - GRIPPER**
_**System Prompt**: Generate PDDL domain code for natural language text descriptions. Do not add comments to the code._ [Conversation Link](https://hf.co/chat/r/y55hLiL)

---
**STEP 1:**
**USER:**
There is a robot with two grippers. It can carry a ball in each. The goal is to take N balls from one room to another; N rises with problem number. Some planners treat the two grippers asymmetrically, giving rise to an unnecessary combinatorial explosion. This domain was created by Jana Koehler.

Requirement: Generate PDDL domain code for the above text description in code blocks delimited only between ```pddl <CODE></CODE> ```. Do not give any explanations.

**STEP 11:**
**USER:**
There is a robot with two grippers. It can carry a ball in each. The goal is to take N balls from one room to another; N rises with problem number. Some planners treat the two grippers asymmetrically, giving rise to an unnecessary combinatorial explosion. This domain was created by Jana Koehler.

Requirement: Generate PDDL domain code for the above text description in code blocks delimited only between ```pddl <CODE></CODE> ```. Do not give any explanations.
