**GPT-4 - LOGISTICS**

---
**STEP 1:**
**USER:**
There are several cities, each containing several locations, some of which are airports. There are also trucks, which can drive within a single city, and airplanes, which can fly between airports. The goal is to get some packages from various locations to various new locations. This domain was created by Bart Selman and Henry Kautz, based on an earlier domain by Manuela Veloso.

Requirement: Generate PDDL domain code for the above text description in code blocks delimited only between ```pddl <CODE></CODE> ```. Do not give any explanations.

**LLM MODEL (GPT-4):**
```
(define (domain city-logistics)
  (:requirements :strips :typing)
  (:types
    location airport city package vehicle airplane truck)
  
  (:predicates
    (at ?p - package ?l - location)
    (in-city ?l - location ?c - city)
    (at-vehicle ?v - vehicle ?l - location)
    (at-airport ?a - airport ?c - city)
    (road-connected ?l1 ?l2 - location)
    (air-route ?a1 ?a2 - airport)
  )

  (:action drive
    :parameters (?t - truck ?from ?to - location ?c - city)
    :precondition (and (at-vehicle ?t ?from) (in-city ?from ?c) (in-city ?to ?c) (road-connected ?from ?to))
    :effect (and (not (at-vehicle ?t ?from)) (at-vehicle ?t ?to))
  )

  (:action fly
    :parameters (?a - airplane ?from ?to - airport ?c1 ?c2 - city)
    :precondition (and (at-vehicle ?a ?from) (at-airport ?from ?c1) (at-airport ?to ?c2) (air-route ?from ?to))
    :effect (and (not (at-vehicle ?a ?from)) (at-vehicle ?a ?to))
  )

  (:action load-package
    :parameters (?p - package ?v - vehicle ?l - location)
    :precondition (and (at ?p ?l) (at-vehicle ?v ?l))
    :effect (not (at ?p ?l))
  )

  (:action unload-package
    :parameters (?p - package ?v - vehicle ?l - location)
    :precondition (and (not (at ?p ?l)) (at-vehicle ?v ?l))
    :effect (at ?p ?l)
  )
)
```

**STEP 2:**
**USER:**
The above code produces the following error -> There is a semantic error where unknown predicate 'not' used in precondition of action. Remove 'not' from the precondition of all actions having it.

Requirement 1: Correct the error and give the entire pddl domain code. 
Requirement 2: Do not create a problem file. Do not use conditional expressions.
Requirement 3: Generate PDDL domain code in code blocks delimited only between ```pddl <CODE></CODE> ```. Do not give any explanations.

**LLM MODEL (GPT-4):**
```
(define (domain city-logistics)
  (:requirements :strips :typing)
  (:types
    location airport city package vehicle airplane truck)
  
  (:predicates
    (at ?p - package ?l - location)
    (in-city ?l - location ?c - city)
    (at-vehicle ?v - vehicle ?l - location)
    (at-airport ?a - airport ?c - city)
    (road-connected ?l1 ?l2 - location)
    (air-route ?a1 ?a2 - airport)
  )

  (:action drive
    :parameters (?t - truck ?from ?to - location ?c - city)
    :precondition (and (at-vehicle ?t ?from) (in-city ?from ?c) (in-city ?to ?c) (road-connected ?from ?to))
    :effect (and (not (at-vehicle ?t ?from)) (at-vehicle ?t ?to))
  )

  (:action fly
    :parameters (?a - airplane ?from ?to - airport ?c1 ?c2 - city)
    :precondition (and (at-vehicle ?a ?from) (at-airport ?from ?c1) (at-airport ?to ?c2) (air-route ?from ?to))
    :effect (and (not (at-vehicle ?a ?from)) (at-vehicle ?a ?to))
  )

  (:action load-package
    :parameters (?p - package ?v - vehicle ?l - location)
    :precondition (and (at ?p ?l) (at-vehicle ?v ?l))
    :effect (not (at ?p ?l))
  )

  (:action unload-package
    :parameters (?p - package ?v - vehicle ?l - location)
    :precondition (at-vehicle ?v ?l)
    :effect (at ?p ?l)
  )
)

**BELOW IS THE PART TO GET THE PROBLEM FROM THE LLM FOR THIS DOMAIN TO SOLVE**

**USER:**
For the above the PDDL domain code, create a problem file in PDDL that when put into a planner to solve will give valid actions and an action path to reach a goal.

**LLM MODEL (GPT-4):**
```
(define (problem city-logistics-problem)
  (:domain city-logistics)
  (:objects
    package1 package2 - package
    loc1 loc2 loc3 - location
    airport1 airport2 - airport
    city1 city2 - city
    truck1 - truck
    airplane1 - airplane
  )

  (:init
    (at package1 loc1)
    (at package2 loc2)
    (in-city loc1 city1)
    (in-city loc2 city1)
    (in-city loc3 city2)
    (road-connected loc1 loc2)
    (at-vehicle truck1 loc1)
    (at-vehicle airplane1 airport1)
    (at-airport airport1 city1)
    (at-airport airport2 city2)
    (air-route airport1 airport2)
  )

  (:goal
    (and
      (at package1 loc3)
      (at package2 loc3)
    )
  )
)
```

**NOTE:** The problem was parsed and solved without any action path found.
**<span style="color:red">{'success': True, 'action_path': None, 'message': 'Action Path Sucessfully Found.'}</span>**
