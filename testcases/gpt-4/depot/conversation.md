**GPT-4 - DEPOT**

---
**STEP 1:**
**USER:**
This domain was devised in order to see what would happen if two previously well-researched domains were joined together. These were the logistics and blocks domains. They are combined to form a domain in which trucks can transport crates around and then the crates must be stacked onto pallets at their destinations. The stacking is achieved using hoists, so the stacking problem is like a blocks-world problem with hands. Trucks can behave like "tables", since the pallets on which crates are stacked are limited.

Requirement: Generate PDDL domain code for the above text description in code blocks delimited only between ```pddl <CODE></CODE> ```. Do not give any explanations.

**LLM MODEL (GPT-4):**
```
(define (domain combined-logistics-blocks)
  (:requirements :strips :typing)
  (:types
    crate pallet truck hoist location)
  
  (:predicates
    (at-truck ?t - truck ?l - location)
    (at-hoist ?h - hoist ?l - location)
    (at-crate ?c - crate ?l - location)
    (on-crate ?c - crate ?p - pallet)
    (on-truck ?c - crate ?t - truck)
    (on-pallet ?c - crate ?p - pallet)
    (empty-hoist ?h - hoist)
    (empty-pallet ?p - pallet)
    (empty-truck ?t - truck)
  )
  
  (:action load-truck
    :parameters (?c - crate ?t - truck ?l - location)
    :precondition (and (at-crate ?c ?l) (at-truck ?t ?l) (empty-truck ?t))
    :effect (and (not (at-crate ?c ?l)) (on-truck ?c ?t) (not (empty-truck ?t)))
  )
  
  (:action unload-truck
    :parameters (?c - crate ?t - truck ?l - location)
    :precondition (and (on-truck ?c ?t) (at-truck ?t ?l))
    :effect (and (not (on-truck ?c ?t)) (at-crate ?c ?l) (empty-truck ?t))
  )
  
  (:action load-pallet
    :parameters (?c - crate ?p - pallet ?h - hoist ?l - location)
    :precondition (and (at-crate ?c ?l) (at-hoist ?h ?l) (empty-hoist ?h) (empty-pallet ?p))
    :effect (and (not (at-crate ?c ?l)) (on-pallet ?c ?p) (not (empty-pallet ?p)))
  )
  
  (:action unload-pallet
    :parameters (?c - crate ?p - pallet ?h - hoist ?l - location)
    :precondition (and (on-pallet ?c ?p) (at-hoist ?h ?l))
    :effect (and (not (on-pallet ?c ?p)) (at-crate ?c ?l) (empty-pallet ?p))

**BELOW IS THE PART TO GET THE PROBLEM FROM THE LLM FOR THIS DOMAIN TO SOLVE**

**USER:**
For the above the PDDL domain code, create a problem file in PDDL that when put into a planner to solve will give valid actions and an action path to reach a goal.

**LLM MODEL (GPT-4):**
```
(define (problem logistics-blocks-problem)
  (:domain combined-logistics-blocks)
  (:objects
    crate1 crate2 - crate
    pallet1 pallet2 - pallet
    truck1 - truck
    hoist1 - hoist
    loc1 loc2 - location
  )

  (:init
    (at-crate crate1 loc1)
    (at-crate crate2 loc1)
    (at-truck truck1 loc1)
    (at-hoist hoist1 loc2)
    (empty-truck truck1)
    (empty-hoist hoist1)
    (empty-pallet pallet1)
    (empty-pallet pallet2)
  )

  (:goal
    (and
      (on-pallet crate1 pallet1)
      (on-pallet crate2 pallet2)
      (at-hoist hoist1 loc2)
      (at-truck truck1 loc2)
    )
  )
)
```

**NOTE:** The problem was parsed and solved without any action path found.
