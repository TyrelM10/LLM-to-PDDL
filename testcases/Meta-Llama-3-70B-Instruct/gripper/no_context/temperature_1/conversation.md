**USER** :
There is a robot with two grippers. It can carry a ball in each. The goal is to take N balls from one room to another; N rises with problem number. Some planners treat the two grippers asymmetrically, giving rise to an unnecessary combinatorial explosion. This domain was created by Jana Koehler.
 
 Instruction: Generate PDDL domain code for the above text description in code blocks delimited only between ```pddl <CODE></CODE> ```. This code should be solved in a STRIPS Planner. Do not give any explanations.

 The above code produces the following error: There is a value error on finding unknown keyword in domain definition: 'actions'. Valid keywords in definition are 'requirements', 'types', 'predicates', 'constants' and 'action'. Remove the keyword 'actions' from definition, keep the rest of code the same.
 
Requirement 1: Correct the error and only give the entire PDDL code for solving in a STRIPS Planner.
 Requirement 2: Do not create a problem file and do not use conditional expressions.
 Requirement 3: Give your output as the PDDL code in code blocks delimited only between ```pddl <CODE></CODE> ``` without any explanations.
