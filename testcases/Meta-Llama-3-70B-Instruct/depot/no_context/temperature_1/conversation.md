**USER** :
This domain was devised in order to see what would happen if two previously well-researched domains were joined together. These were the logistics and blocks domains. They are combined to form a domain in which trucks can transport crates around and then the crates must be stacked onto pallets at their destinations. The stacking is achieved using hoists, so the stacking problem is like a blocks-world problem with hands. Trucks can behave like "tables", since the pallets on which crates are stacked are limited.
 
 Instruction: Generate PDDL domain code for the above text description in code blocks delimited only between ```pddl <CODE></CODE> ```. This code should be solved in a STRIPS Planner. Do not give any explanations.

 The above code produces the following error: There is a value error on finding unknown keyword in domain definition: 'actions'. Valid keywords in definition are 'requirements', 'types', 'predicates', 'constants' and 'action'. Remove the keyword 'actions' from definition, keep the rest of code the same.
 
Requirement 1: Correct the error and only give the entire PDDL code for solving in a STRIPS Planner.
 Requirement 2: Do not create a problem file and do not use conditional expressions.
 Requirement 3: Give your output as the PDDL code in code blocks delimited only between ```pddl <CODE></CODE> ``` without any explanations.
