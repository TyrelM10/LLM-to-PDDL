**USER** :Please generate PDDL domain code for the following text description: The blocks world is one of the most famous planning domains in artificial intelligence. Imagine a set of cubes (blocks) sitting on a table. The goal is to build one or more vertical stacks of blocks. The catch is that only one block may be moved at a time: it may either be placed on the table or placed atop another block. Because of this, any blocks that are, at a given time, under another block cannot be moved.

 The above code produces the following error :'Error unknown type block used in predicate definition'
 Correct the error and give the entire pddl code. Ignore creating a problem file.
