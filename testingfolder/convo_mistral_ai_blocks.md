**USER** :```The blocks world is one of the most famous planning domains in artificial intelligence. Imagine a set of cubes (blocks) sitting on a table. The goal is to build one or more vertical stacks of blocks. The catch is that only one block may be moved at a time: it may either be placed on the table or placed atop another block. Because of this, any blocks that are, at a given time, under another block cannot be moved.```
 Please generate PDDL domain code for the following text description that is delimited by triple backticks above. 
 Instructions to follow while generating: 
 1)Give me the answer in PDDL code formatted between triple backticks, for example 
```pddl 
 (define (domain domainname) 
 (:requirements :strips :typing) 
 (:types typesrequired) 
 (:predicates predicatesrequired) 
 (:action actionrequired) 
 (:parameters parametersrequired) 
 (:precondition preconditionrequired) 
 (:effect effectrequired) 
```

 The above code produces the following error: Error multiple parent definition must start with "either"
 Correct the error and give the entire pddl code. Do not create a problem file.
